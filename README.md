# Monty Hall Paradox Demo

This is a simple desktop application written in **C++** with **Qt** to demonstrate and experiment with the famous Monty Hall Paradox.

## What is the Monty Hall Paradox?

The Monty Hall Paradox is a probability puzzle based on a TV game show scenario:
1. You pick one of three doors, each of which might contain a prize.
2. The host, who knows where the prize is, opens one of the remaining doorsâ€”always revealing no prize (e.g., a goat).
3. You then have a choice: **stick** with your original door, or **switch** to the other unopened door.

**Surprisingly**, switching doors increases your chances of winning from 1/3 to 2/3.

## How to Run

1. Download and unzip (if needed) the application files.
2. Locate and run **`kazik.exe`**.
3. Play around with the options to see how switching or staying affects the outcome over multiple trials.

Enjoy exploring the Monty Hall Paradox!
